Hi everyone! 

Welcome to my first blog post. 

<h2>a litte about me</h2>

My name is Le Minh Loc, I'm 14 years old and currently living in Viet Nam.

I love programming and have been coding for 3 years, I have done projects ranging from video games, software, website to deep learning/machine learning projects.

Programming languages that I know: C++, C#, Python, Javascript, and HTML & CSS.

I have also received many awards in programming, science, and technology competitions.

<h2>some of my projects</h2>

<h1>Social Distance Detection (Apply -Bird Eye View)</h1>

and this blog website

<h1>Why did I make this blog site?</h1>

well, I love blogging and have tried many blogging sites like:    

* WordPress     
*  Google sites     
*  Wix    
*   Blogger


But I don't like to use them very much because of limited website design (or maybe I'm dumb) and their logo appears everywhere on my blog site, so I decided to make my own blog website.

This website was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, mostly following tutorials but I also added other features myself.

If you have any feedback, let me know!

Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
